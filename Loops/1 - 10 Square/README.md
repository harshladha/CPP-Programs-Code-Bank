# Squares of Numbers 1 to 10

This C++ program calculates and prints the squares of the numbers from 1 to 10 using a `while` loop.

---

## 🚀 How It Works

- Initializes `a = 1`
- Repeats while `a <= 10`
  - Calculates `b = a * a`
  - Prints the square of `a`
  - Increments `a` by 1
- Uses `clrscr()` to clear the screen and `getch()` to pause output (Turbo C++ specific)
