# Sum of Numbers from 1 to 10

This C++ program calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to 10 using a `while` loop.

---

## 🚀 How It Works

- Initializes variables:
  - `a = 0` (accumulator for the sum)
  - `i = 1` (loop counter)
- Uses `while(i <= 10)` to:
  - Add `i` to `a`
  - Increment `i`
- Prints the final sum
- Uses `clrscr()` to clear the screen and `getch()` to pause output (*Turbo C++ specific*)
