# Print Powers of 2 Sequence

This C++ program prints the powers of 2 from 2‚Å∞ to 2‚Åπ using a `while` loop and the `pow()` function.

---

## üöÄ How It Works

- Initializes:
  - `i = 0` as the loop counter
  - `a` to store each calculated power
- Uses a `while` loop that runs while `i <= 9`:
  - Calculates `a = pow(2, i)`
  - Prints the current value of `a`
  - Increments `i` by 1
- After printing all lines, `getch()` waits for a keypress.
- Uses `clrscr()` to clear the screen (*Turbo C++ specific*).
