# Print Squares of Numbers from 1 to N

This C++ program calculates and prints the squares of numbers from 1 to a user-specified value using a `while` loop.

---

## 🚀 How It Works

- Prompts the user to enter a value `b` (upper limit).
- Initializes:
  - `a = 1` as the loop counter
- Uses a `while` loop that runs while `a <= b`:
  - Calculates the square: `c = a * a`
  - Prints the square value `c`
  - Increments `a` by 1
- Uses `clrscr()` to clear the screen and `getch()` to pause output (*Turbo C++ specific*).
