# Print Numbers from 15 to 1

This C++ program prints numbers from 15 down to 1 in descending order using a `while` loop.

---

## 🚀 How It Works

- Initializes:
  - `a = 15` as the starting number.
- Uses a `while` loop that runs while `a >= 1`:
  - Prints the current value of `a`
  - Decrements `a` by 1
- After all numbers are printed, `getch()` waits for a keypress.
- Uses `clrscr()` to clear the screen (*Turbo C++ specific*).
