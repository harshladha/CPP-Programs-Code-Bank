# Print Right-Angled Triangle Number Pattern

This C++ program prints a right-angled triangle pattern of increasing numbers using nested `for` loops.

---

## 🚀 How It Works

- The outer `for` loop (`i`) runs from 1 to 5, controlling the number of rows.
- For each row:
  - The inner `for` loop (`j`) runs from 1 up to `i`, printing numbers in increasing order.
- After each row, `cout<<"\n";` moves to the next line.
- Uses `clrscr()` to clear the screen and `getch()` to pause output (*Turbo C++ specific*).
